This is Jemula
==============

Jemula is a kernel for event-driven stochastic simulation. Since it is prepared to simulate real-time systems, we prefer to refer to it as an "emulator" instead of just a plain simulator. Jemula is used in the [Jemula802](https://github.com/schmist/Jemula802) project.
